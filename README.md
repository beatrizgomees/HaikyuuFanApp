# App Haikyuu

A flutter project made for fans of the anime Haikyuu

## 

In the project, Flutter technologies were used to build the mobile application.
Supabase was also used, a tool with the possibility of creating Postgres database, authentication services and generating APIs instantly.
Consuming the data present in my database in Supabase, I can display it using Flutter

My database contains all the necessary information

    My components, components where the components and sections of the application will be located

    The domain folder where the application entities are placed and the repository, where I build my functions

    The shared folder where I place everything that is shared within the application, which can always be reused, such as constants, themes, design and widgets

    The views folder where the application screens are located.
